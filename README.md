# Scrapers Codex 2

Public mirror of the local folder "Scrapers Codex_Github_codex 2".

This repository contains assorted scraping scripts and related helpers. If you
use Python, consider setting up a virtual environment and storing credentials
in a local `.env` file (ignored by git).

Quick start

- Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && .venv\\Scripts\\activate`
- Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` exists): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add environment variables in `.env` as needed.

Notes

- Sensitive files like `.env`, virtualenvs, caches, and build artifacts are
  ignored via `.gitignore`.
